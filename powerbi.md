# SandDance in Power BI

This GitHub repo contains the code for the "new" SandDance, and has been released to AppSource as "SandDance 2019".

## FAQ
* Q: Will my reports using the *SandDance* custom visual automatically upgrade to *SandDance 2019*?
<br/>

* Q: Is the old *SandDance* still available?
<br/>
A: It is not visible in the marketplace. Any existing reports containing the *SandDance* custom visual will continue to work as usual.

* Q: Does *SandDance 2019* have all of the functionality from its predecessor?
<br/>
A: It is very similar, but not all features have been re-implemented. Please [create an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/SandDance/issues/new) to let us know what missing features you need. We'll do our best to add it.
